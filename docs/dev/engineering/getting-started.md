# Getting started

## First time setup

If you haven't already, download and install Firefox Nightly from [here](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/channel/desktop/) before running the below commands.

Install dependencies using [yarn v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/):

```bash
yarn install
```

Now either continue with [Local development](./local-development.md) or [Building and installing the extension](./building-and-installing-the-extension.md)
