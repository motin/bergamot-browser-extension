# Getting started

## First time setup

Install dependencies using [yarn v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/):

```bash
yarn install
```

Now either continue with [Local development](./local-development.md) or [Building and installing the extension](./building-and-installing-the-extension.md)
