# Introduction

Firefox Translations allows neural machine translation to happen directly in the browser, without having any content sent to an external server.

The current version allows translation from Spanish, Estonian and Czech in and out of English, as well as English into German.

Installation instructions are found [here](./install.md).

> **Note** Firefox Translations is an experimental feature.

### The Bergamot project

This project was made possible through the combined effort of [all researchers and partners in the Bergamot project](https://browser.mt/partners/). The translation models are prepared as part of the Bergamot project ([https://github.com/browsermt/students]()). The translation engine used is [Bergamot Translator](https://github.com/browsermt/bergamot-translator) which is based on [Marian](https://github.com/marian-nmt/marian-dev).

The Bergamot project adds and improves client-side machine translation in the web browser.

Unlike current cloud-based options, running directly on users’ machines empowers citizens to preserve their privacy and increases the uptake of language technologies in Europe in various sectors that require confidentiality. Free software integrated with open-source web browsers, such as Mozilla Firefox, enables bottom-up adoption by non-experts, resulting in cost savings for private and public sector users who would otherwise procure translation or operate monolingually.
