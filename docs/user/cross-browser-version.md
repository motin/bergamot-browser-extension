# Cross-browser version

Firefox Translations is currently a Firefox-only feature since it uses native browser UI elements and takes advantage of Firefox-specific optimizations.

In the past, and possibly sometime in the future, there was/will be releases of cross-browser versions of the feature. The cross-browser version uses no Firefox-specific UI or optimizations.

## Installation on Chrome

- If you haven't already, download and install [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/canary/) since the current release requires bleeding edge browser capabilities.
- Download the latest Chrome zip file, linked [here](https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/firefox-translations/releases/download/v0.4.3/bergamot-browser-extension-0.4.3-chrome-cross-browser-ui.zip)
- Unpack the zip file locally
- Start Chrome Canary with the following extra argument: `--js-flags="--experimental-wasm-simd"`, eg `/Applications/Google\ Chrome\ Canary.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome\ Canary --js-flags="--experimental-wasm-simd"`
- Enter `chrome://extensions` in Chrome's address bar and press enter
- Flip the Developer mode switch up on the right so that the toolbar with the `Load unpacked`, `Pack extension` and `Update` buttons are shown
- Click `Load unpacked`
- Choose the directory that you unpacked from the zip file
- Note that the extension icon may not be visible directly. Click the puzzle icon far to the right of the address bar and click the pin symbol next to the Bergamot Translate icon so that the pin becomes blue. This will make the Bergamot Translate extension icon show at all times.

## Installation on Firefox

### Preparations

- The current release requires bleeding edge browser capabilities. If you haven't already, download and install Firefox Nightly (English or German edition) from [https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-nightly](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/all/#product-desktop-nightly).
- Optionally [create a new profile](https://developer.mozilla.org/Firefox/Multiple_profiles)

### Configuring Nightly and installing the extension

- Make sure that the following preferences are set to `true` in `about:config`:
  - `xpinstall.signatures.dev-root` (Create this pref if it doesn't exist. This is required to be able to test these unreleased candidate builds)
- Make sure that the following preferences are set to `false` in `about:config`:
  - `xpinstall.signatures.required` (This enables the use of ordinary extensions in the same profile)
- Click [here](https://github.com/mozilla-extensions/firefox-translations/releases/download/v0.4.3/bergamot-browser-extension-0.4.3-firefox-cross-browser-ui.xpi) to start the download and installation of the extension
- Wait for the extension to be downloaded
- Click `Add` in the popup that comes up
- The extension is now installed
